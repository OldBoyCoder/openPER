There are two sources of data for vehicle information in release 84 of ePER
The CH file.  This contains details of xxx vehicles
The RT file.  This contains details of xxx vehicles.  Every vehicle in the RT file is also in the CH file.  The data in the RT file is richer than that contained in the CH file but there are some
items that are only in the CH file such as production date.

In both files there is evidence of incorrect data.  Examples found so far:
I suspect the files we're provided with are based on a bring together of data from a variety of sources and production lines over a prolonged time period.
This gives plenty of opportunity to introduce differences in approach, format and conventions.  I've tried to reconcile these as best I can but if you see anything odd let me know
Also let me know if ePer can find your car but openPer can't, it may mean I've misunderstood something in the data. 
Bizarre production dates.  Most dates ar eiher six characters in format YYMMDD or eight characters in format YYYYMMDD.  However, there are many examples of other date formats
One in particular seems to affect cars produced for the Indian market.  I've tried to puzzle out these date formats without success.  Suffice to say if the date looks weird in openPER
then let me know, especially if you know the production for your car as that might help me understand the format.
